              <p class="card-text"><b>INGREDIENTS</b><br>
                1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter<br>
                12-24 small tender thyme sprigs plus 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped leaves<br>
                1 garlic clove, minced<br>
                1 3/4 pounds small waxy potatoes (such as Yukon Gold or German Butterball), each slightly larger than a golf ball<br>
                2 teaspoons kosher salt<br>
                Freshly ground black pepper<br>
                <br>
                <b>Special Equipment</b><br>
                A standard 12-cup muffin pan; a mandoline.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>RECIPE PREPARATION</b>
                    <br>
                    Preheat oven to 350°. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Brush muffin cups all over with butter. Line bottoms with parchment-paper rounds. Arrange 1-2 small thyme sprigs in center of each round. Drizzle 1/2 teaspoon butter into bottom of each cup.<br>
                    Add chopped thyme and garlic to remaining butter in saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.<br>
                    Using mandoline, slice potatoes crosswise into very thin rounds (less than 1/16-inch thick), placing them in a large bowl as you work. Pour herb butter over and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat well.<br>
                    Divide potato slices among muffin cups, layering overlapping slices to create a circular pattern. Lightly press center of each to make compact. Drizzle any remaining butter and seasoning from bowl over.<br>
                    Cover muffin pan tightly with foil and place on a baking sheet. Bake until potatoes can be pierced easily with the tip of a knife, about 35 minutes. Remove foil; invert a rimmed baking sheet over pan. Turn, lightly tapping on counter, releasing potatoes onto sheet. Rearrange any slices that may have fallen out. Using a metal spatula, carefully turn cakes, thyme sprigs facing down. Discard parchment. DO AHEAD Potatoes can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.<br>
                    Increase heat to 425°. Uncover cakes if needed. Bake until bottoms and edges are golden and crispy, 25-30 minutes. Carefully turn cakes, thyme sprigs facing up.              <p class="card-text"><small class="text-muted">Last updated 3 mins ago</small></p>
